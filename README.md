# Start-Rocking
Mac OSX app that will remind you to play music if Spotify is paused.


1. com.startrocking.plist - for launching the menubar app on system startup
2. run.sh - it will copy apple script to desktop and above plist to Library which is required to launch app on startup and also run.sh copies Start Rocking app to Applications folder, since all applications need to be present in that folder.
